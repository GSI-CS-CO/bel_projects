-- prerequisites:

-- for test setup in TTF and BG2A.A9 (invoked from 'tsl101'):

    test_ttf_nw_perf.sh   - measure network performance using a small testbed with RX/TX SCUs and a WRS.
                            WRS must be configured with a corresponding dot-config (ie., dot-config_timing_mps_access).
                            LEMO cabling between the RX and TX SCUs is necessary (RX:B1 - TX:B2).
                            Applicable testbeds:
                                TTF:
                                    nwt0297: scuxl0497 (RX, wri2), scuxl0396 (TX, wri10)
                                BG2A.A9:
                                    nwt0470: scuxl0321 (RX, wri2), scuxl0264 (TX, wri10)
                                    nwt0471: scuxl0411 (RX, wri2), scuxl0329 (TX, wri10)
                                    nwt0472: scuxl0305 (RX, wri2), scuxl0339 (TX, wri10)
    test_ttf_basic.sh     - test timing message transmission (with MPS protocol) between
                            TX and RX nodes that are connected to nwt0297
                            It's intended to be used by Makefile.
                            For stand-alone run, launch it: ./test_ttf_basic.sh -u root
    test_ttf_high_load.sh - test timing message transmission (with MPS protocol) by Xenabay
                            nwt0297 can be configured with (dot-config_timing_mps_access) or
                            w/o VLANs (dot-config.xenabay)
    test_ttf_traffic      - measure the data reception rate
                            results are reported in wiki (https://wiki.gsi.de/TOS/Timing/Intern/ProbingMPSEventSignalling)

-- for test setup in HO  (invoked from 'acopc017'):
    make <target>

- wrs: White Rabbit switch artifacts
    dot-config_*          - configurations for access switch

- xena: Xenabay traffic analyzer and generator configurations
    *.vmcfg               - XenaBay testbeds
    testbed_*             - directories with schedule, capture filter etc
