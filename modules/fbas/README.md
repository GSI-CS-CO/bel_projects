## 1. Introduction

In general, the purpose of all Machine Protection Systems (**MPS**) is to protect the beam production machines (UNILAC, SIS18, etc) from damage in dangerous situations.
One of these MPSs is the Fast Beam Abort System (**FBAS**) for the SIS100 machine.

According to the Technical Concept ([pdf)](https://www-acc.gsi.de/wiki/pub/Timing/Intern/MPS/F-TC-C-03e_SIS100_Fast_Beam_Abort_System_Requirements_v1.0.pdf)), FBAS shall utilize the Timing network and Timing Receivers (**TR**) for signaling MPS events.
In MPS context, events are declared as changes of any machine protection condition.
For FBAS, such MPS events shall be distributed as timing events between the transmitter and receiver logic modules (SCUs).

The final goal of the project is to develop embedded modules for the FBAS event signaling system,  in form of:
   - firmware for embedded CPU (LM32) in TR
   - API for user-space program (saftlib driver/plug-in)
   - WR timing network

## 2. Status

This project is in the development stage.

In order to probe FBAS event signaling and measure network performance a demo firmware for LM32 is implemented.
The work result is published in the Timing wiki site ([link](https://www-acc.gsi.de/wiki/bin/view/Timing/Intern/ProbingMPSEventSignalling)).

Directory structure:
   - fw: contains firmware source files and Makefile
   - include: header files
   - test: test artifacts (scripts, WRS configuration, DM schedule etc)

## 3. Build, install and debug a LM32 firmware

### 3.1. Build firmware binary (.bin) locally

Makefile is used to build the firmware binaries (.bin, .elf). Invoke a command given below:

```
$ make           # it will build firmware, fbas16/fbas.scucontrol.bin
$ make clean     # deletes all artifacts
```

### 3.2. Install a firmware binary to a target TR

Load the firmware binary to the target device using **eb-fwload**.

```
$ eb-reset dev/wbm0 cpuhalt 0            # halt LM32
$ eb-fwload dev/wbm0 u 0x0 <firmware>    # load firmware to LM32 (with id 0 if multiple instances of LM32 exist)
$ eb-reset dev/wbm0 cpureset 0           # (optional) restart the firmware
```

### 3.3. Debug the firmware

The lowest __debug level__ (eg., 3) should be set in **Makefile** so that all debug messages can be sent via UART.
Debug output messages output by each TR can be shown using **eb-console**, so launch it in additional terminal.

```
$ eb-console dev/wbm0     # in another terminal
```

A piece of the debug output message is given below as example.

```

```

## 4. Tests

There are several test cases available in 'bel_projects/modules/fbas/test/tools'.

   - measure signaling network performance (test_ttf_nw_perf.sh)
   - test timing message transmission (test_ttf_basic.sh)
   - other

Basic test setup is built in TTF:
   - nwt0297m66: WR switch (*WRS*) configured with 'dot-config_timing_access_fbas'
   - scuxl0396: TX SCU
   - scuxl0497: RX SCU

If TTF test setup will be used, then it's recommended to run tests in any management master host (ie., tsl101).
All test-relevant artifacts can be deployed with a helper script ('bel_projects/modules/fbas/test/deploy_mngmt_host.sh') to the management master host (in the '$HOME/fbas_test' directory).

### 4.1. Running a test case

All TRs must have their IP address before testing: either per BOOTP or manually.

```
$ (sudo) eb-console dev/wbm0   # launch WR console
$ wrc# ip                      # check an IP address
$ wrc# ip set 192.168.131.30   # set an IP address, if it's missing
```

Assume, test artifacts are successfully deployed in 'tsl101'.

In order to start a desired test case, switch to the '$HOME/fbas_test/tools' directory.

### 4.2. Measure the signaling network performance

Here, signaling latency and some internal timing delay are measured:
   - one-way delay: from timing message transmission at a TX node to reception of corresponding timing message at a RX node
   - transmission delay: from FBAS event detection at a TX node to reception of corresponding timing message at a RX node
   - signaling latency: from FBAS event detection at a TX node to corresponding output signal generation at a RX node

TX SCU is configured to act on 2 events: FBAS and feedback (IO).
   - on detection of FBAS event, the TX SCU generates a MPS flag and broadcasts it via WR network.
   - on feedback event, the TX node calculates the elapsed time to signal FBAS event.

Similarly, RX SCU is configured to act on timing event (with MPS flag) and drives its output port to signal the FBAS event reception.
The feedback channel from RX SCU to TX SCU is made of the LEMO cable connection: RX:IO1 to TX:IO2.

The FBAS event is simulated by injecting a timing event TX SCU locally with **saft-ctl** tool.
The required event configuration for RX/TX SCUs is done also with **saft-ecpu-ctl** and **saft-io-ctl** tools.

All procedures of the test are scripted in 'test_ttf_nw_perf.sh'.

## 5. Q&A

### 5.1. Compiler/linker errors/warnings

#### 5.1.1. Shared libraries (libmpfr.so.4) not found

If cross-compiler cannot be run:

```
bel_projects/toolchain/bin/../libexec/gcc/lm32-elf/4.5.3/cc1: error while loading shared libraries: libmpfr.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

Follow the instructions given in 'bel_projects':

   - Ubuntu/Mint: [link](https://github.com/GSI-CS-CO/bel_projects#common-errors-and-warnings)
   - Rocky 9: [link](https://github.com/GSI-CS-CO/bel_projects/tree/master/res/rocky-9)

#### 5.1.2. Linker returns a bunch of error messages with 'ebm_' prefix.

```
/tmp/cchA6kkO.o: In function `fwlib_ebmInit':
common-fwlib.c:(.text.fwlib_ebmInit+0xd8): undefined reference to `ebm_init'
common-fwlib.c:(.text.fwlib_ebmInit+0xd8): relocation truncated to fit: R_LM32_CALL against undefined symbol `ebm_init'
```

Solution:

Edit Makefile so that missing components from the **lm32-include** module must be compiled. In this case a missing component is **ebm**.
So append **$(INCPATH)/ebm.c** to the existing target rule in **Makefile**.

```
$(TARGET).elf: $(PATHFW)/fbastx.c **$(INCPATH)/ebm.c** $(PATHFW)/../../common-libs/fw/common-fwlib.c
```

#### 5.1.3. Compiler claims an undeclared identifier

```
fbastx.c: In function ‘initSharedMem’:
fbastx.c:106:71: error: ‘pCpuRamExternal’ undeclared (first use in this function)
```

Solution: check variable declaration (probably typo)

### 5.2. Run-time errors/warnings

#### 5.2.1. Getting MAC/IP addresses fails

If the MAC/IP address detection fails, then debug output contains similar message given below:

```
fbastx: ERROR - init of EB master failed! 5
```

Solution:

   - [x] check network connection, if a timing receiver is connected to an WRS
   - [x] check link with **eb-console**
   - [x] check RVLAN status of WRS (**rvlan-status** on WRS)
   - [x] check if RADIUS server is reachable (**radtest** on WRS)

### 5.3. Other errors/warnings

#### 5.3.1. WR console

##### 5.3.1.1. Why warnings given below are printed repeatedly on WR console?

Warning: tx timestamp never became available
Warning: tx not terminated infinite mcr=0x51001410

Answer: unclear :-(
