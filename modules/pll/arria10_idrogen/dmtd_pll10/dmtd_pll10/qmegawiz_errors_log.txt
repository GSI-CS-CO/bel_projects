Oct 16 03PM:36:25>: File has no filename extension.
Do you want to edit the file anyway?

Oct 16 03PM:36:42>: MegaWizard Plug-In Manager does not recognize /home/alex/workspace/projects/r13/bel_projects/modules/pll/arria10/dmtd_pll10/dmtd_pll10/dmtd_pll10.xml as a wizard-generated
custom megafunction variation.

Do you want to use a wizard to overwrite it?
