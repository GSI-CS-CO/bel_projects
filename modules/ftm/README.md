# Datamaster Firmware, Library and Tools
The ftm module contains LM32 firmware and for the host the libcarpedm
and tools to control the datamaster and to manipulate the schedules.

# Table of Contents

# Components

## LM32 Firmware
ftm.bin is the LM32 firmware. libcarpedm connects to the firmware via
etherbone. The version of the firmware must be compatible to the version
of the library.

## libcarpedm
libcarpedm.so is the datamaster library. It is linked to the tools and
used by FESA classes.

## Tools
### dm-cmd
dm-cmd is used to control the datamaster from command line. It is mainly
a tool for development and debugging error situations.

### dm-sched
dm-sched is used to manipulate the schedules in the datamaster from
command line. It is mainly a tool for development and debugging error
situations.

### Other Tools
There are some more tools to analyse schedules and to convert the
command history of a datamaster.

CommandsHistory.py: convert a command log from a datamaster into a
sequence of commands. This is used to replay the commands for
debugging.

scheduleCompare: compare two schedules. This is used to check schedules
if they represent the same schedule even if the text representation is
different.

replaceChain: contract chains in a schedule to a new node replacing the
chain. This is used to simplyfy large schedules and to allow structure
analysis.

## Tests
The folder tests/ contains Python3 (pytest) based automated tests for
the tools, the library, and the firmware.

# Build Instructions
Use make in the folder ftmx86/ to build the library and the tools.
Use make in the folder tests/ to run the automated tests.
Use make in the folder analysis/scheduleCompare/main to build
scheduleCompare and replaceChain.
Use make ftm.bin in the folder syn/gsi_pexarria5/ftm/ to build the LM32
firmware ftm.bin.
