\texttt{target} is a block node where the queues are configured.
\begin{lstlisting}[style = helptext]
  rawqueue <target>         Dump all meta information of the command 
                            queues of the block <target> including 
                            commands
  start                     Request start of selected thread. 
                            Requires a valid origin.

                            Does reverse lookup of current pattern, 
                            prone to race condition
  abort                     Immediately abort selected thread.
  halt                      Immediately aborts all threads on all CPUs.
  lock <target>             Locks all queues of a block for asynchronous
                            queue manipulation mode. This makes the
                            queues invisible to the DM and allowing 
                            modification during active runtime. 
                            ACTIVE LOCK MEANS DM WILL NEITHER WRITE TO 
                            NOR READ FROM THIS BLOCK'S QUEUES!
  clear <target>            Clears all queues of a locked block 
                            allowing modification/refill during 
                            active runtime.
  unlock <target>           Unlocks all queues of a block, making 
                            them visible to the DM.
  asyncflush <target>  <prios>         Flushes all pending commands 
                            of given priorities (3b Hi-Md-Lo -> 
                            0x0..0x7) in an locked block of the schedule
  asyncclear                           (ToDo)
  unlock <target>                      Unlocks a block from 
                            asynchronous queue manipulation mode
  showlocks <target>                   Lists all currently locked blocks
  staticflush <target> <prios>         Flushes all pending commands 
                            of given priorities (3b Hi-Md-Lo -> 
                            0x0..0x7) in an inactive (static) 
                            block of the schedule
  staticflushpattern <pattern> <prios> Flushes all pending commands 
                            of given priorities (3b Hi-Md-Lo -> 
                            0x0..0x7) in an inactive (static) 
                            pattern of the schedule
  force                                (ToDo)
  rawvisited [<target>]     Show 1 for a visited node, 0 for not visited.
                            If no target node is given, show all nodes.

Queued commands (viable options in square brackets):
  stop <target> [laps]                 Request stop at 
                                       selected block (flow to idle)

                                       commands of given priorities 
                                       (3b, 0x0..0x7) le cmd priority
Options for queued commands:
