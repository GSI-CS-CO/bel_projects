Install sdcc		sdcc.sourceforge.net
	(Firmware successfully compiles with sdcc 3.2.0)
Install cycfx2prog	http://www.triplespark.net/elec/periph/USB-FX2/software/

Go into cyfx2usbuart directory

Run 'make' to compile the firmware
Run 'make run' to download the firmware to the mcu

After downloading the firmware the chip enumerates as ftdi chip and can be accessed
with 'socat - /dev/ttyUSB0,echo=0,b38400'. Listen to /var/log/messages to see which
file (ttyUSB*) is created in /dev/ for the serial device when the chip enumerates.

Any byte sent to /dev/ttyUSB* will be transmitted on UART and will loop back on
/dev/ttyUSB*.  
Any byte received by UART will be transmitted to /dev/ttyUSB*.

UART TX Pin = Port A Pin 1
UART RX Pin = Part A Pin 0

Only baudrate 38400 is supported.
