; This is an example of using the Xena scripting language to set-up and
; execute a simple test case.
;
; This file is simply sent to TCP/IP port 22611 on a Xena chassis,
; and while it is executing on the chassis it sends lines of text
; back on the same TCP/IP connection.
;
; Much of what you see in response from the chassis is an "<OK>" for
; each new parameter value that you have sent. There will also be a
; blank line in response to each comment you send to the chassis. More
; importantly, of course, you will see the values of the parameters and
; statistics that you explicitly query for.
;
; The chassis has a basic "WAIT" command to allow simple server-side
; waiting. For more advanced scripting logic, you should use a client-
; side scripting environment like Tcl/Perl/Python/Basic/C to send commands
; to the chassis, and retrieve and parse the responses.
;
; The example works on a single port configured in TX-to-RX loop mode
; so that everything sent is also received on the same port.

; First we authenticate the connection to the chassis and provide a user
; name for reservation:
; Login is done at the xena_parser script
; C_LOGON "xena"
; C_OWNER "example"

; We now set a default port for the session so that all port-specific
; parameters go to this port; this also gives you a single place to edit
; if you want to run the example on a different port. The syntax is
; simply "m/p" where "m" is the module number and "p" is the port number:
0/2

; Let's see what kind of port this is by querying for the interface type:
P_INTERFACE ?

; Now relinquish and reserve the port, clear any existing configuration, 
; and set it in loop-mode:
P_RESERVATION RELINQUISH
P_RESERVATION RESERVE
P_RESET
P_LOOPBACK TXON2RX

; Make a stream for transmitting 1000 packets of varying size at a 50% of
; the wire rate for the port. The packet data is just an Ethernet header,
; and we put a modifier on the last byte of the MAC destination address.
; The rest of the packet payload is and incrementing pattern of bytes.
; Finally we insert a Xena test payload at the end containing a TID value
; of 77. We use index 10 for the stream definition itself:
PS_CREATE [10]
PS_COMMENT [10] "Example stream of 1000 packets"
PS_PACKETLIMIT [10] 1000
PS_PACKETLENGTH [10] RANDOM 100 200
PS_RATEFRACTION [10] 500000
PS_MODIFIERCOUNT [10] 1
PS_MODIFIER [10,0] 5 0xFF000000 DEC 1
PS_PAYLOAD [10] INCREMENTING
PS_TPLDID [10] 77
PS_ENABLE [10] ON

; That was the stream definition. Until now we have been sending values
; to the chassis. Now we'll ask for information from the chassis just to
; verify our configuration. Queries have the same format as used when
; setting values, but with a "?" instead of the values:
PS_PACKETLENGTH [10] ?
P_MACADDRESS ?
; You can also ask for multiple parameters a at time using some special
; pseudo-parameters. Here we'll query for the complete stream definition.
; This will give us all the parameters defined for the stream, including
; some which we have not set explicitly and therefore still have their
; default values from when the configuration was reset:
PS_CONFIG [10] ?

; When parsing the responses from a multi-parameter query you cannot
; immediately tell which parameter value is the last one. To establish a
; fix-point in the stream of response lines you can issue the special "SYNC"
; command which simply responds with "<SYNC>"; so when you receive this
; response you know that there are no more parameters coming:
SYNC

; We're finally ready to run some traffic, but before we start the stream
; we have just defined we'll start the capture function and send out a single
; packet. Since we are in loop mode this packet will be captured on our port,
; and we'll pull it over to the client:

P_CAPTURE ON
P_XMITONE 0x001122334455,AABBCCDDEEFF,2222,FEDCBA9876543210,00000000
PC_STATS ?
PC_PACKET [0] ?

; Ok, now we'll start the stream. Capture is already on. Since this may be a
; slow port we insert a short wait period to make sure all 1000 packets are
; sent, and then we query for the TX and RX statistics:
P_TRAFFIC ON
WAIT 3
PT_ALL ?
PR_ALL ?

; All the packets should have been captured. We pull in a few of them to see
; the varying length and check that the modifier has correctly varied the 5th
; byte. We'll use another multi-parameter query that gives us both the packet
; data and the extra information available for each capture event:
PC_STATS ?
PC_INFO [1] ?
PC_INFO [2] ?
PC_INFO [3] ?
PC_INFO [4] ?
PC_INFO [5] ?

; Even though the single stream of the port has run dry we must still explicitly
; stop traffic generation, and we also stop capturing:
P_TRAFFIC OFF
P_CAPTURE OFF

; That's it.
; You have now seen how to build a stream, transmit the packets, do some
; capturing, and issue queries for statistics, capture, and configuration.
